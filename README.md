Shows a few cool examples of using swig with Ruby.   
The examples are about
* A Simple Class   
* A function   
* Constants  
* STL :: vector   
* STL :: set     

One of the coolest things is the usage of C++ stl contatiners namely Vector and Set.  
We can see that you can use c++ set to get elements in sorted order.  

Try these commands    
ruby extconf.rb    
make    
irb -r./example
